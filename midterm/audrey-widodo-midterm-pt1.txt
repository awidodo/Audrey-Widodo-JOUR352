Questions

1.  In the sentence below, put in the necessary code that would allow users to click on the word Google and open Google's homepage in a new browser:

Google is the best search engine in the world.

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> is the best search engine in the world </p>

2.  Describe the purpose of a DIV tag.
The <div> tag is used in an HTML document to define a section and act as container for the elements that can be styled using a class or id attribute using a CSS stylesheet. Any kind of content can be put inside the <div> tag. Here is an example of how DIV tags can be used:

HTML
<div id="example">Audrey's Midterm</div>

CSS
#example {
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
font-size:13px;
}


3.  Write out the basic structure of an HTML page, putting the basic tags in the correct position.  (Note: you don't need to connect it to a stylesheet or include DIV tags or anything like that).

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>insert text here</p>
</body>
</html>


4.  There are two main "areas" or "sections" in the basic structure of an HTML page. In which area would you put a link to a stylesheet?

The two areas in a basic structure of an HTML include the head contents, which holds structural information and metadata about the html that are not visible to users, and the body, which only contains the information displayed on the html that can be viewed by users.

A link to a stylesheet would be placed in the head area because it is an external stylesheet that contains metadata for the html and is not displayed on the html site.


5.  In which main "area" or "section" of an HTML page would you put text, images or DIV tags?

For text, images, and DIV tags, you would put that in the body section of the HTML page, because you want that to be visible for the user.


6.  In the space below, put one DIV tag with a class of graphicbox and a second DIV tag with an ID of name.

<div class="graphicbox"></div>
<div id = "name"></div>

7.  In the space below, put one DIV tag with an ID of apples and a class of fruit.
<div id="apples" class="fruit">
</div>

8.  In the space below, write the correct CSS code to target a DIV with a class of fruit.  Make the color of the text black (#000000).
.fruit {
color:#000000;
}

9.  What tag would we use to include an image on an HTML page? Just give me the name of the tag, you don't have to write out all the code.

The tag is <img> to embed an image into a webpage and below is an example of what it would look like:

<img src = "insert path to image here" alt = "insert text">

10.  Why do we use media queries?

A media query is a feature in CSS that allows content to be rendered and adapted to different screen sizes or conditions. We use media queries because they allow for the content layout to be displayed legibly in various conditions such as for desktop, mobile, tablets, and other devices. It's helpful for the users to easily see the content of a webpage across multiple screen sizes.


11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?

A serif font has a stroke at the ends of the letter, usually at the feet, while a serif font is more clean and precise with no decorative embellishments. Examples of serif fonts include, Georgia and Times New Roman. Examples of sans-serif fonts include, Arial, Courier New, and Verdana.


12. Which of the following is a hexadecimal code? To answer, delete the options that are not a hexadecimal code.
#FFCC33
